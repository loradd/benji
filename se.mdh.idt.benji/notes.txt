** Multi-threading **
The DesignSpaceExplorer class delegates all thread management 
operations to the GlobalContext class, which in turn uses the 
EMFHelper class to clone models. In our scenario, we delegate 
all trace management operations to TraceAdapter instances, i.e. 
the creation of traceLinks at edit time. Unfortunately, EMFHelper 
does not support the creation of an equivalent TraceAdapter instance. 
Indeed, we also need to attach an EContentAdapter whenever cloning 
a resource. The same process is executed in TraceBuilder.build
